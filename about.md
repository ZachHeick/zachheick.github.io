Hello! My name is Zach Heick and I'm from Park Ridge, Illinois. From September 2017 up to mid December 2017, I will be devoting my time to a 12-week Data Science Bootcamp at Metis in Chicago. This blog will be here to share my experiences at Metis and other data science or software developement related topics.
