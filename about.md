Hello! My name is Zach Heick and I'm from Chicago, Illinois. I'm a recent graduate of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp in Chicago and am actively pursuing for a full-time role in data science. This blog will be here to share my experiences at Metis and other data science or software developement related topics.
