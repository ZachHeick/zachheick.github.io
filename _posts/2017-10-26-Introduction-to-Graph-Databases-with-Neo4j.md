title: Introduction to Graph Databases with Neo4j  
---  

Relational database management systems (RDBMS) have been the go-to data storage system for many years. The strong theoretical foundation of relational databases and frequent use has led to the availability of many stable and standardized products. While relational databases fit well into many projects, there are trade-offs. I'll be going over some of these trade-offs and discuss why a graph database management system, such as Neo4j, might be better suited for the job. I'll also give a quick tutorial on how to set up and use Neo4j on your local machine!
