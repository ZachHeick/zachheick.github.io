title: Mix Retriever&#58; A Hip-Hop Playlist Generator   
---  

I love discovering new music, especially when it comes to Hip-Hop. Today, music streaming platforms offer thousands of dynamic playlists for finding new music that cover topics such as specific artists, genres, time of year, and many more. *What if we can't find a playlist built around a particular song that we like*? For the fifth and final project at Metis, we were given the freedom to solve any problem we were interested using any of the data science techniques and technologies we've learned from the bootcamp. My favorite topics covered were NLP and recommendation systems, and I wanted to solve this problem with techniques from these topics.  

## Current Solutions  

If we want a playlist built around a certain song that we like, we could look for a playlist someone else already made, but a playlist might not exist for that song. Another option is using an existing playlist generator. These existing playlist generators prioritize artists and genres, as well as looking at similar songs others have listened to. Some things that might not be prioritized or included at all in these playlist generators are the lyrical meanings between songs in a playlist and the overall "mood" of the playlist. Lyrical similarities between songs paired with a similar mood can make playlists much more cohesive and personal.  

## My Solution  

To combine the functionality of individual song-based playlist generators with a focus on making content based recommendations, I created a web app [Mix Retriever](http://www.mixretriever.com/) that builds a hip-hop playlist of songs with similar lyrical meaning and mood.
